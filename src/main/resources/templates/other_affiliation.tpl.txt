An affiliation not known to the database has been put into the project request
form as the affiliation of a supervisor.

Please check the following three fields for typos and, if appropriate, add them
to the project database:

Institution: __INSTITUTION__
Division   : __DIVISION__
Department : __DEPARTMENT__

If you create a new institution for this supervisor, please also consider
adding the institution's code to the "academicInstitutionCodes" list in
grand_unified_user_creator. If you are unsure how to do this, please consult
a maintainer of the panadmin toolkit.
